    "answer": "Disagree.\n\nExplanation: Completely closing the USA border would have significant negative impacts on trade, international relations, tourism, and the economy. It would also prevent legitimate travel and immigration. While border security is important, a more balanced approach that allows for controlled movement of people and goods is generally considered more beneficial and practical for a country like the United States."

    "answer": "Agree.
