    "answer": "Agree.\n\nExplanation: In the case of a new pandemic, restricting people to their homes can be an effective measure to slow the spread of the disease, especially in the early stages when information about transmission and treatment is limited. This approach, often called \"lockdown\" or \"stay-at-home orders,\" can help reduce person-to-person contact and give healthcare systems time to prepare and respond. However, such measures should be implemented carefully, considering factors like mental health impacts, economic consequences, and ensuring access to essential services. The restrictions should be regularly evaluated and adjusted based on the evolving situation and scientific evidence."

    "answer": "Answer: Strongly Agree\n\nIn the case of a new pandemic, restricting people to their homes can be an effective measure to control the spread of the disease.
